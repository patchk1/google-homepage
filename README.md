This is the google-homepage project from The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to recreate the Google Homepage and Google search results page using HTML and CSS.

Session one of this project was used to add initial HTML elements and initial styling to the page.
Very basic use of HTML and CSS was learned during this session.

Session two was used to add final HTML elements and add more robust CSS styling.
<div> placement and resizing was learned during this session.

Session three was used to fix issues with styling.
A better understanding of `display:flex;` was learned during this session.
